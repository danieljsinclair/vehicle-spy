"""Emit the shared multi-line coverage summary block.

This is the BLOCK-EMISSION helper shared by the engine-sim-cli and engine-sim-app
``coverage-summary`` Makefile targets. It mirrors the visual block the bridge's
own ``coverage_summary.py`` prints (Overall / source / local / source /
exclusions applied), but contains NONE of the bridge-specific extras (top-5
worst, dead-stripped detection, ESP32/platform guards). Those belong to the
bridge; this helper is intentionally minimal and parameterized.

Block format (matches the bridge):

    Overall Coverage (SonarCloud): X%  covered/total
    source: live https://sonarcloud.io /api/measures/component
    local <type>: Y%  covered/total lines
    source: <local coverage file>
    exclusions applied (sonar scope): <sonar-project.properties>

Coloring matches the bridge exactly: BOLD + threshold color on the percentage
(green >=80 / cyan >=60 / yellow >=40 / orange >0 / red =0), grey on the rest.
The "local <type>" line is OMITTED when ``--local-type none`` (or no local
coverage path is given) — callers without a local source (currently none, but
kept honest) must not fabricate a local number.

Local coverage sources supported:

    lcov : an lcov.info file (llvm-cov export). Aggregated over /src/ SF
           records, the same scope rule the bridge uses. Falls back to ALL
           records when no /src/ record is present.
    xccov: an ``xcrun xccov view --report --json`` JSON file. Uses the
           top-level coveredLines/executableLines aggregates.
    xml  : a SonarCloud generic-coverage XML — the CONVERTED report
           (lcov_to_xml.py / xccov_to_sonar.py output) that sonar-scanner
           uploads. Preferred for the local headline: it puts local on the
           SAME basis as SonarCloud's ingested input, so any remaining gap
           is a genuine scope difference, not a raw-vs-converted mismatch.
    none : no local source; the local line is omitted.

SonarCloud-live GET mirrors the bridge: reads SONAR_TOKEN_ES / SONAR_TOKEN and
calls ``/api/measures/component?metricKeys=coverage,lines_to_cover,
uncovered_lines`` for the given project key. Falls back gracefully (local only
+ a "sonar unavailable" note) when there is no token or the fetch/parse fails.

Usage:

    coverage_block.py --project-key KEY \\
        [--local-cov PATH --local-type lcov|xccov|xml] \\
        [--exclusions PATH] [--label TEXT]

Exit codes: 0 always (a missing token / fetch failure / absent local file is
reported in-line, never a crash — this is a display helper, not a build step).
