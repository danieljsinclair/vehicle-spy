"""Display a SonarCloud issue summary from a cached or live API report.

UNIFIED FORMAT: this script produces the SAME output layout as the engine-sim
repos (engine-sim-bridge / engine-sim-cli / engine-sim-app), so every repo in
the workspace prints an identical SonarCloud issues summary:

    === [label] BEGIN: SonarCloud issues summary ===

    === label SonarCloud Issues ===
      Open issues: N  (Total N)

      Issues by severity (highest impact per issue):
        Severity      : BLOCKER  ...
        ...

      Top issues (critical-first, OPEN set):
        [SEVERITY] [rule] file:line - description
        ...

    === [label] END: SonarCloud issues summary ===

The report is the JSON returned by ``/api/issues/search`` (filtered to
``statuses=OPEN`` and requested with ``facets=impactSeverities`` by the
Makefile curl). The severity breakdown is read STRAIGHT from the API's
``impactSeverities`` facet -- the SAME server-side counting the SonarCloud
dashboard uses -- rather than re-derived per issue in Python.

Top issues are always sorted "critical-first" (highest impact severity first,
ties broken by type severity, then by rule) so the most important findings lead,
and each line carries the rule (e.g. ``cpp:S5421``) for a direct rule-page jump.

Usage:
    sonar_summary.py <report.json> [--label NAME] [--removed-facet <path>]
